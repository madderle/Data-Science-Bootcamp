    "1. Will use a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model since its a binary classifier and just trying to determing positive or not positive.\n",
    "2. The key metric will be accuracy. Satisficing metrics will be sensistivity (negative rate) and specificity (positive rate).\n",
    "3. Since only using 1 model, will split the data 80:20\n",
    "4. Will have to look at dealing with sampling. Since it will be unbalanced.\n",
    "5. Will perform feature engineer to find the best words associated with positive rating, and negative ratings. (Will do Simple NLP)\n",
    "6. Will then do a select k best to select the best features.\n",
    "7. Will perform a grid search to find the best parameters for the model, and do some hyper parameter searching.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem covers the probabilistic relationship between multiple variables, and specifically allows us to define one conditional in terms of the underlying probabilities and the inverse condition. Specifically, it can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y|x) = P(y)P(x|y)/P(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In English this reads as \"the probability of y given x equals the probability of y times the probability of x given y divided by the probability of x.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem can be extended to when x is a vector (containing the multiple x variables used as inputs for the model) to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y|x_1,...,x_n) = P(y)P(x_1,...,x_n|y)/P(x_1,...,x_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This explains the relationship of an outcome to a vector of conditions rather than to a single other event. Recall that this can be read as the probability of y, in the case of our model the categorical outcome we’re interested in, given a set of observations is equal to the probability of that set of observations given y divided by the probability of that set of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Assume the variables are independent.\n",
    "2. Wont handle new data, so the training set needs to be actually representative of what going to see. So any new words wont be handled."
