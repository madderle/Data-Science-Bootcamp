    "Recall that the logistic regression model's best performance on the test set was 93%.  See what you can do to improve performance.  Suggested avenues of investigation include: Other modeling techniques (SVM?), making more features that take advantage of the spaCy information (include grammar, phrases, POS, etc), making sentence-level features (number of words, amount of punctuation), or including contextual information (length of previous and next sentences, words repeated from one sentence to the next, etc), and anything else your heart desires.  Make sure to design your models on the test set, or use cross_validation with multiple folds, and see if you can get accuracy above 90%.  "
